          <p class="card-text site-text">Power RP is an established roleplay community that was founded on the 1st of February 2020 with two highly motivated developers who aimed to bring a realistic, ethical and enjoyable roleplay experience to the FiveM community. After initially starting off as a small project, Power RP has expanded far past this and continues to bring new, improved features to enhance the roleplaying experience along with features and updates the community requests and voices for.

            Power RP aims to allow each player to create a virtual life where they can create a character who they always managed to be and live their wildest dreams, in simpler terms we try to keep everything within the limits of how your real life would be but in the limits of the Los Santos and the Grand Theft Auto world. The Power RP team is always active and looking for new features and ideas that we know the Power RP community will love.</p>

            <p>Since starting Power RP in 2020, two talented friends have teamed up to develop and bring their ideas to life by working hard & continuously everyday. With that being said, these five friends spontaneously one day were sick of playing on other servers and holding back their ideas so they created their own discord and FiveM server. From it’s programming, map editing, vehicle development or Discord development, we’re always looking for talented individuals to assist the Power RP team out with this everlasting project.</p>
            <p>If you feel you have what it takes and may have some unique skills to provide to our community and its development and bring a new set of skills & ideas to the team, feel free to drop by our discord and open a ticket in #Support explaining so. Our Discord will be provided if you’re interested Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/Ts6M6X5" target="_blank">Join</a> Please note, this is a community effort, do not contact me with paid offers or negotiations of pay for work, this is solely against FiveM’s TOS and we are not interested.
             <br> Thanks for taking an interest in Power RP and taking the time to read through this, we look forward to seeing you soon. - The Power RP Team</p>
